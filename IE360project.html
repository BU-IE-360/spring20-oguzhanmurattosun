PROJECT
1. Introduction
Trendyol is a site that offers users the opportunity to shop online. Nowadays, millions of people do their shopping online, and Trendyol is one of the most trusted websites in our country. While this site addresses a large group of users, enormous demands occur, and to be able to meet these demands, reliable and healthy forecasts must be done. Forecasting relies on historical data, used methods, and modeling skills. Decisions such as pricing, inventory placement, etc. require reliable forecasts, and inaccurate information could result in actual or opportunity losses. Here, the importance of making correct predictions come into play, but forecasting the sales quantities of a product is a challenging task. The data involves daily sales of 8 products of Trendyol. Our task was to regularly provide the next day’s predictions of all products by using the sales data the day before. The data also had product, category level, brand, and site level details. These details were important because while making forecasts for products, we could see what trends they can have. While sales of some products change seasonally, some products may continue in the same trend all seasons. For example, while making a forecast for the “Bikini Üstü”, the season effect must be taken into consideration. Brand data was also important because the popularity of a brand may affect the sales of all sub-products. Site level data was useful, too. Day of the week, special events like Valentine’s Day can affect the sales, and by using site level data, special days can be identified from the site traffic. This robust dataset could be used to improve forecasting accuracy, but we were also free to use any external data if necessary. We were free to use any forecasting methods as we desire. One of the techniques that we were used in the project was exponential smoothing. The exponential smoothing method exponentially decreases the weights from newest to oldest observation. Another technique that we were used was the Arima method. The exponential smoothing and Arima methods will be explained in detail in Approach part.

2. Related Literature
“Forecasting in R” and “Forecasting Product Demand in R” assignments from DataCamp and the course materials are used mainly in the project. We also did a literature review and reached some articles that may help us during the project session. In the ‘A survey on retail sales forecasting and prediction in fashion markets’ and ‘Performance of state space and ARIMA models for consumer retail sales forecasting’ articles, we learned about the methods that can be used and the factors like seasonality may affect predictions. The related articles can be found in the reference part for further information.[1] and [2]

3. Approach
In the project, we carried out two different models, which are Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Arima, to predict the sales quantity of a product for online retail in the Trendyol. Arima: “Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average” is a model that clarifies a time series concerning historical data which the data own lags and the lagged forecast errors.[3] The Exponential Smoothing(ETS): this model uses with ETS function, which calculates or predicts a future value based on existing(historical) values, but the model uses mostly the latest data in the calculation, every recent data provides a better forecast result in the model. The predicted value is continued historical data, which should be a continuous timeline.[4] For the project, to carry out the model, the data needed to be arranged. Therefore, the data of eight products were separated according to the product content id, and separate data sets were created. Next, time series were created for every product. The time series beginning date was determined according to the time of sales starts on the website. For every product, the different times were determined according to their sales time. Besides, MSEs are calculated for Arima and ETS models of each product. The time series is fitted to the related model which gives the lowest error rate. After the model detected, the forecast was made according to the determined model. For the coat product, which has the 3904356 product id, we did not do analyses because the sales were always zero during the forecast period. Also, the bikini product, which has the 5926527 product id, an analysis in detail was not done since the sales were mostly zero or one during the forecast period. Since the sales rate of this product was very low, it would hardly have had an impact on the competition score (created according to WMAPE).

4. Results
In the project, the forecasting was carried out about eight products of the Trendyol. These products were “Mont”, “Bikini Üstü”, “Şarj Edebilir Diş Fırçası”, “Tayt”, “Süpürge”, “Telefon Bluetooth Kulaklık”, “Islak Mendil & Havlu”, and “Yüz Temizleyicisi”. Each product forecast was tried to be managed by Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or Arima models. Some of the products gave the lowest MSE with the ETS model, which are “Tayt” and “Bikini Üstü”. Others provided the lowest MSE with the Exponential Smoothing (ETS). The results are as follows:

31515569-tayt-72427,17(ETS)-83869,59(Arima) / 32939029-şarj edilebilir diş fırçası-17637,14(ETS)-12508,84(Arima) / 4066298-ıslak mendil&havlu-323435,90(ETS)-309218,80(Arima) / 5926527-bikini üstü-54167,33(ETS)-74958,22(Arima) / 6676673-telefon bluetooth kulaklık-863754,10(ETS)-746641,60(Arima) / 61886-süpürge-1742,77(ETS)-1699,34(Arima) / 85004-yüz temizleyicisi-985,33(ETS)-854,09(Arima)

After determining which model to use for each product, the time series of the products were fitted to the related model. After that, forecasts were made in this way. During the competition covering between 16.05.2020 and 13.06.2020, you can see the daily ranking points we have obtained in Table 2. The groups in the competition are ranked according to their daily WMAPEs, and it is determined how many points each group will get. For example, if 25 groups made submission that day, the first group gets 25 points, while the second group gets 24 points and the third group 23 points, etc. If a group does not make any submission, the group get 0 point for that day.

Day-16-May:10 / Day-17-May:25 / Day-18-May:20 / Day-19-May:17 / Day-20-May:19 / Day-20-May:19 / Day-21-May:16 / Day-22-May:10 / Day-23-May:16 / Day-24-May:11 / Day-25-May:19 / Day-26-May:16 / Day-27-May:14 / Day-28-May:21 / Day-29-May:19 / Day-30-May:18 / Day-31-May:23 / Day-01-June:13 / Day-02-June:13 / Day-03-June:10 / Day-04-June:17 / Day-05-June:15 / Day-06-June:25 / Day-07-June:11 / Day-08-June:18 / Day-09-June:7 / Day-10-June:21 / Day-11-June:18 / Day-12-June:17 / Day-13-June:19 / Grand score:478

5. Conclusion
In the project, after separating product data according to product content id, different models and approaches are analyzed: Arima and the Exponential Smoothing (ETS). These approaches have some advantages and disadvantages to each other. Finally, the forecasts were made using the ETS or Arima model for each product according to their MSE. In our method, a more straightforward way was followed compared to many other methods. Apart from the data given, data using other unique trends could be included in the forecast approach. However, we have followed a simple prediction process considering the historical sales rates over the given data. On the other hand, new approaches that may give better results can be used in the forecasting process for future work.
